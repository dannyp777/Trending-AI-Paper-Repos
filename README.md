# Trending-AI-Paper-Repos
Curated AI/ML/DL research papers for researchers, analysts, academics, hackers, and tech professionals.

This repository contains a curated list of trending AI research papers. The list is updated regularly to include the latest and most impactful research in the field of AI.

## Contents

The repository currently includes the following files:

- `trendingAIPaperRepos.csv`: A CSV file containing a list of trending AI papers.
- `trendingAIPaperRepos.json`: A JSON file containing the same list in a different format.

In the future, an SQLite database file may be added to provide another way to access and query the data.

## Usage

You can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dannyp777/trending-ai-paper-repos.git
```

Once cloned, you can open the CSV or JSON file in any text editor or data analysis tool to view the list of papers.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you come across a trending AI paper that is not included in the list, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Future Plans

In the future, a script may be added to automatically update the CSV and JSON files with the latest trending AI papers.
